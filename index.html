                I’m a computer science and economics double-major at Dartmouth College. Though I only started coding a year ago, computer science has quickly become my favorite subject and pastime. Recently I’ve enjoyed exploring web development (this website is a product of that exploration) and building basic video games. I've also become a teacher’s assistant for two computer science professors. Outside the realm of cs, I enjoy playing on the ultimate team, intramural sports, hiking (I recently hiked the Tour de Mont Blanc), basketball, and musicals.

                I was introduced to coding my freshman spring in CS1. At first I struggled; many times I didn’t know how to start an assignment. I would read through instructions ten times, but my professor’s words didn’t translate to code in my head. In time things started to click. As coding become easier, it became lots more fun. I found myself procrastinating work for my other classes by doing extra credit on cs labs.

                The following term I was selected to be a teacher’s assistant for Professor Farid’s CS1 class and I will continue to TA for Professor Balkcom this coming winter. My responsibilities include leading a one-hour recitation for ten students once a week and lots of grading. It’s awesome to play a formative role introducing my classmates to cs while also solidifying my own knowledge of the subject.

                In addition to teaching computer science in recitation, I <a href="#" class="description" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#spanishModal">taught Spanish</a> to three classes in an elementary school, and math and reading to kids grades K-12 at the Kumon center in Norwich, VT.

                I spent the summer after my freshman year of college working as a campaign fellow for Matt Dunne For Governor. Though we were not successful in winning the primary, I am grateful for my experience. I was pushed far outside my comfort zone, engaging with thousands of Vermont voters, developed new skills like writing letters to the editor and crafting scripts for our phone banks, gained lots of knowledge about state politics and issues, and was inspired by Matt and my coworkers. I especially enjoyed staffing Matt and driving him to all corners of Vermont to get to fundraisers, rallies, debates and interviews. Spending up to 16 hours of the day with Matt, I got to talk with him about campaign strategy and political issues, meet state senators and representatives, mayors and reporters, as well as Jerry Greenfield of Ben and Jerry’s.

                As a junior in high school I joined 44 other juniors from around the world at The Mountain School. Together, we grew our own food, cut wood to heat the campus, and stayed up all night writing papers and preparing speeches. I enjoyed <a href="#" class="description" data-toggle="modal" data-target="#experienceModal">my experience</a> farming so much that I applied to work at <a href="http://nofavt.org/csa/honey-locust-farm" class="description">Honey Locust Farm</a> the following summer.

                I first got involved in musical theater as a freshman in high school. That year I sung in the chorus. The following year I was more comfortable on stage and acquired a small role in South Pacific. Next, I had a small role in In The Heights and joined the lighting crew. During rehearsals, I watched 20 complete run-throughs from my lofty perch in the lighting booth. I disliked being pigeonholed in the lighting booth when I yearned to be on stage. As Usnavi sang far below me, I mouthed every line and acted out his part. Through my headset, I sang the duet, "Champagne," with Colby the stage manager. My senior year I finally auditioned for a lead role. I survived auditions, and when the cast list was posted, my name was on it. Taking the stage as Heathcliffe in Disco Inferno left me better prepared to make sure my voice gets heard and to step into new roles going into the future.

            <p>Controlling a classroom full of small, hyperactive miscreants is a task unto itself. Teaching them anything of substance is another matter entirely. I never grasped the difficulty of teaching until I tried it myself at Westshire Elementary School in West Fairlee, Vermont. I taught three separate hour-long classes every week for nine weeks, plus an hour of prep time. At Westshire, I learned why teaching is such a challenging endeavor. Good teachers balance discipline with fun; I could not. I was unable to have fun with my students without letting them get out of control. I eventually resorted to bribing them. When we played a learning game, I rewarded the winner with candy. This strategy worked well for me, and I eventually gave everyone in my class a reward for trying, not just the “winners.” My students now know over 100 Spanish words and phrases.</p>

            <p>I learned that while I may be a mediocre teacher, my teachers are amazing. Because of my experience teaching Spanish, I have a deeper appreciation for all of them.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>The Mountain School is a family of  teachers, students, firemen, athletes, musicians, and academics, hidden in rural Vershire, Vermont. Another school like it can never exist. The people shape the place as much as the place shapes the people. We come from different backgrounds yet we’re remarkably the same. It takes a certain type of person to want to live here. We are people aiming to improve ourselves and those around us. We are people with a purpose.

          	<p>Robert Frost wrote, “My object in living is to unite my avocation and my vocation.” Because of the individuals here, I know what that looks like. It looks like Sugar-man Sam throwing wood into the evaporator, Alden preforming The Love Song of J. Alfred Prufrock in English class, and Kathy unveiling her cinnamon rolls at snack time. I’m eager to learn here because I glean passion from the people surrounding me.
          	My English teacher loves poetry so I’ve learned to like it. Never before have I memorized a poem out of my own free will. Alden’s class is the first English class since the third grade that I’ve enjoyed.</p>

          	<p>I think part of it has to do with seeing teachers from more than one angle. We live with them and we meet their families. We become each others’ families. They are our advisors, friends, and mentors. Over dinner, I can discuss my French assignment with Kareen. When I have a problem, I can knock on her door and she’s happy to help. There’s no better way to end the day than in her company at dorm-meeting.
          	Teachers are there to comfort us yet they also challenge us. I’ve been pushed further academically than ever before. And I’ve also been pushed to feel mutually responsible for everything that happens here.</p>

          	<p>One thursday night I saw Jack in the kitchen. He was cleaning up after the dish crew that had left the place in disarray. My dish crew. He was sacrificing his evening to clean up after some teenagers who were in too much a hurry to do their part. He didn’t expect an apology and he wasn’t angry. I felt morally inclined to help him and in that moment, I learned something no other school can teach.</p>

          	<p>Jack does so many jobs that mostly go unnoticed. He’s teaching a silent lesson that goes beyond the Mountain School. He makes me wonder how much other people do for me that I don’t know about. It’s a comforting thought and I know the only way I can repay that favor is by doing my own part, and more.</p>

          	<p>When I hear myself say “why haven’t they cleaned this up yet,” I have to stop myself. The truth is “why haven’t I cleaned it up yet?” When the kitchen is left untidy, everyone should feel complicity because it’s all of our responsibilities to keep this place clean.</p>

          	<p>This is why the Mountain School feels like home. Teachers and students alike work together to achieve a common goal. Every little thing we do is for each other, whether it’s washing counters, splitting wood, or scrubbing potatoes. At the Mountain School, we cultivate land and good character. It’s our place and we take care of it.</p>

          </div>
          <div class="modal-body">
            <p>It was an act of rebellion, driving to Honey Locust Farm. I was about to start my first real job. I fidgeted, pondering the consequences of turning back. What propelled me forward was fear - of facing my dad, admitting failure.</p>

            <p>I had ignored my father's advice by accepting this job. The day we drove to Sunny Meadow for my interview, he let me know he wasn't impressed with the farmer, Jake. Afterwards my dad drove me to another, more-established farm. I refused to get out of the car. The harder he pushed, the more I resisted.</p>

            <p>You could say it was stubbornness that got me to work on Day One. I call it determination. I turned into the driveway, parked, wiped the sweat off my hands.
            Jake was leaning against a Chevy pickup loaded with crates of silent, cowering roosters. I walked over. We shook hands, exchanging awkward pleasantries.</p>

            <p>Jake instructed me to pull a chicken from its crate. It jerked and squawked. It tried to open its wings; I clamped them shut. Jake led me to the 'gallows,' a steel cone with the bottom cut off. He stuffed my chicken into the gallows upside down; its head protruded from the hole in the bottom, while its feet stuck out the top. Deftly, Jake pulled a knife and slit the chicken's throat. My stomach tensed. The steel cone gyrated as the chicken convulsed. Its neck whipped around, spewing blood. Dark splotches spread across my T-shirt and shorts. Then the chicken hung limp.</p>

            <p>Jake seized another chicken, stuffing it into the gallows. He gave me the knife and gestured expectantly. Could I perform the heinous act? I was the kid who used to cry whenever my cat killed a bird. And there I was, about to commit murder. What would Jake do if I refused? I almost quit on the spot; instead, I willed my hand to work.</p>

            <p>Words can't describe what happened next; the outcome was unspeakably horrible.</p>

            <p>Jake smirked. "You messed the poor guy up," he scolded. He pulled the knife from my clammy hands and decapitated the chicken. I felt my cheeks turn crimson.</p>

            <p>I stared at the concrete, strewn with blood and feathers. I was twenty minutes into a ten-hour day, and I had broken a moral barrier. It was a triumph of sorts, but not one that I wished to repeat.</p>

            <p>Jake didn't ask me to kill another chicken. Instead, he handed me over to Mary, a portly woman who carried her sleeping baby strapped to her back. Mary taught me to eviscerate. We worked together like a well-oiled machine; she killed and de-feathered the chickens while I gutted them. Soon I had evisceration down to a science. But to say the day flew by would be a lie. When your hair is matted with blood, and your hands reek with the stench of chicken guts, time passes slowly.</p>

            <p>After work I went out with friends. They all ordered chicken wings; I opted for nachos. Weeks would pass before I had an appetite for chicken again. But the next morning, I was back at the farm, ready for work.</p>

            <p>Jake greeted me with a smile instead of a smirk. I had passed the test. Day Two at the farm marked the beginning of a longstanding friendship.</p>

            <p>Jake and his wife Leah treated me like family. They invited me often for dinner, I gave Leah mandolin lessons, and Jake offered me bushels of free produce. Yet Jake's greatest gift was forcing me to make a choice: perform the heinous act or quit. In so choosing, I learned to take risks without fearing failure, and now it is confidence, not fear, that propels me forward - whether playing basketball, or playing Heathcliffe in Disco Inferno.</p>

            <p>What began as an act of rebellion became the most fulfilling adventure of my life.</p>

            <p class="projectText">In this program, the user clicks on a pixel in the webcam to select a color. We then employ a "region growing" algorithm to expand outward from the selected pixel, detecting and recoloring all other pixels of a similar color. In painting mode, the user can use the detected region as a paintbrush on the webcam.</p>

            <p class="projectText">This project recreates an efficient approach to detecting collisions in a two-dimensional space. The inefficient approach is to check each object to see if it's colliding with another object. Instead, just as a binary search tree enables faster look-up than linear search in one dimension, a point quadtree enables faster look-up in two dimensions. </p>
