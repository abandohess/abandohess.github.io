                I’m a computer science and economics double-major at Dartmouth College. Though I only started coding a year ago, computer science has quickly become my favorite subject and pastime. Recently I’ve enjoyed exploring web devolopment (this website is a product of that exploration), building basic video games and become a teacher’s assistant for two computer science professors. Outside the realm of cs, I enjoy playing on the ultimate team, intramural sports, hiking (I recently hiked the Tour de Mont Blanc), playing basketball and musicals.

                I was introduced to coding my freshman spring in CS1. At first I struggled; many times I didn’t know how to start an assignment. I would read through instructions ten times, but my professor’s words didn’t translate to code in my head. In time things started to click. As coding become easier, it became lots more fun. I found myself procrastinating work for my other classes by doing extra credit on cs labs.

                The following term I was selected to be a teacher’s assistant for Professor Farid’s CS1 class and I will continue to TA for Professor Balkcom this coming winter. My responsibilities include leading a one-hour recitation for ten students once a week and lots of grading. It’s awesome to play a formative role introducing my classmates to cs while also solidifying my own knowledge of the subject.

                In addition to teaching computer science in recitation, I <a href="#" class="description">taught Spanish</a> to three classes in an elementary school, and math and reading to kids grades K-12 at the Kumon center in Norwich, VT.

                I spent the summer after my freshman year of college working as a campaign fellow for Matt Dunne For GovernorLINK. Though we were not successful in winning the primary, I am grateful for my experience. I was pushed far outside my comfort zone, engaging with thousands of Vermont voters, developed new skills like writing letters to the editor and crafting scripts for our phone banks, gained lots of knowledge about state politics and issues, and was inspired by Matt and my coworkers. I especially enjoyed staffing Matt and driving him to all corners of Vermont to get to fundraisers, rallies, debates and interviews. Spending up to 16 hours of the day with Matt, I got to talk with him about campaign strategy and political issues, meet state senators and representatives, mayors and reporters, as well as Jerry Greenfield of Ben and Jerry’s.

                As a junior in high school I joined 44 other juniors from around the world at The Mountain School. Together, we grew our own food, cut wood to heat the campus, and stayed up all night writing papers and preparing speeches. I enjoyed my <a href="#" class="description">experience</a> farming so much that I applied to work at <a href="http://nofavt.org/csa/honey-locust-farm" class="description">Honey Locust Farm</a> the following summer. On my first day of work I learned to <a href="#" class="description">slaughter and process poultry.</a> Thankfully we only slaughtered once a month, so I spent the rest of my time tilling and brush hogging with the tractor, and planting, weeding, harvesting and selling produce. The next summer I did much of the same back at The Mountain School, preparing the fields and produce for the incoming fall semester.

                I first got involved in musical theater as a freshman in high school. That year I sung in the chorus. The following year I was more comfortable on stage and acquired a small role in South Pacific. Next, I had a small role in In The Heights and joined the lighting crew. During rehearsals, I watched 20 complete run-throughs from my lofty perch in the lighting booth. I disliked being pigeonholed in the lighting booth when I yearned to be on stage. As Usnavi sang far below me, I mouthed every line and acted out his part. Through my headset, I sang the duet, "Champagne," with Colby the stage manager. My senior year I finally auditioned for a lead role. I survived auditions, and when the cast list was posted, my name was on it. Taking the sage as Heathcliff in Disco Inferno left me better prepared to make sure my voice gets heard and to step into new roles going into the future.
